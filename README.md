### Project Information
Project Name: Mastermind

Project Description: Mastermind Java Game is an engaging and interactive console-based application inspired by the classic Mastermind board game. It challenges players to test their logic and deduction skills by guessing a secret code within a limited number of attempts. In our latest update, we've introduced three new algorithms: random, minimax, and DFS (Depth-First Search) to enhance the gameplay experience and offer varied strategic approaches for players.

### Key Features

1. Code Generation: The game generates a secret code made up of a sequence of four number pegs for the player to guess.

2. Player Input: Players enter their guesses through the console, trying to crack the secret code within a specified number of attempts.

3. Feedback System: After each guess, the game provides feedback to the player, indicating how accurate their guess was. Feedback typically consists of clues, indicating correct pegs in the correct position (represented as *) and correct pegs in the wrong position (represented as +).

4. Limited Attempts: Players have a limited number of attempts (up to 12 attempts) to guess the correct code, adding an element of strategy and urgency to the gameplay.

5. Random Algorithm: The game generates a random code for the player to guess.

6. Minimax Algorithm: The game generates a code based on the minimax algorithm for the player to guess.

7. DFS Algorithm: The game generates a code based on the DFS algorithm for the player to guess.

### How to run it

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your IDE of choice.
3. Run the `Main.java` file via this directory: `./src/main/java/hw01/Main`.
4. Follow the instructions in the console to play the game.
5. Enjoy!
6. (Optional) To run the JUnit tests, navigate to the `./src/test/java/hw01` directory and run `CodeBreaker.java` and `CodeMaker.java` files.
